        "A sore throat refers to pain, itchiness, or irritation of the throat. You may have difficulty swallowing food and liquids, and the pain may get worse when you try to swallow. A bacterial infection can also cause a sore throat. These types of infections include: 1  strep throat: inflammation of the throat caused by the Streptococcal bacteria. 2  diphtheria: infectious disease that causes throat inflammation.",
        "Viruses cause most sore throats, but bacteria, such as streptococcus, which causes strep throat, may be the cause of a sore throat. An antibiotic can help get rid of the bacteria and provide relief. If your sore throat isn\u2019t gone within a week, or if it gets worse and leads to a fever, you may need a prescription. ",

        "Sore throats can be painful and annoying. Fortunately, most sore throats are caused by a minor illness and go away without medical treatment. Several conditions can cause a sore throat. Sore throats may be caused by a viral illness, such as: 1  The common cold, the most common type of viral infection. 2  Infection of the voice box (laryngitis). 3  Mononucleosis (mono, the kissing disease), a viral infection that tends to cause a persistent sore throat. A bacterial infection may also cause a sore throat. This can occur from: 1  Strep throat, which usually does not occur with congestion or a cough. 2  An inflammation or infection of the tonsils (tonsillitis) and sometimes the adenoids (adenoiditis). 3  An infection of the tissues around the tonsils (peritonsillar abscess).",
        "Sore throat may be caused by bacteria or viruses, while strep throat is only caused by bacteria. The term strep throat is more commonly used in the USA and Canada, compared to other English speaking countries. Strep throat may also be referred to as Streptococcal pharyngitis or streptococcal sore throat. These conditions are usually caused by an infection: Sore throat is usually caused by inflammation (swelling) in the back of the throat (oropharynx) and tonsils (laryngeal lymphoid nodules). Infections can be caused by the streptococcus bacteria (causing strep throat) or viruses.",

        "Question: Every time I plant tulips, they seem to come up only one or two years, then they disappear. Do you have any advice for getting tulips to come back year after year after year, like my daffodils and crocus do? Answer: Hybrid tulips are not strongly perennial in most gardens. This ensures large bulbs that will bloom well one year, but then they typically split themselves into smaller bulbs that can take years to grow back to blooming size. Also, tulips are native to areas such as the Turkish mountains where they receive no rainfall in summer and enjoy excellent drainage.",
        "If you decide to try to get your tulips to rebloom year after year, the most important things you can do is choose the right location to plant your tulips. The location MUST be well drained and in full sun. The more intense the sun the better. This dry soil will help tulips bloom. Plant only old fashioned tulips. While the newer hybrids are very spectacular, they are far less likely to rebloom from year to year. The old fashions tulips (heirlooms) are more forgiving when it comes to getting the right environment and are more likely to bloom year after year.",
        "Tulips are an elegant blossom, long valued for their beauty and grace. Tulips have a place in the garden and in cut flower bouquets, or they may be planted in indoor pots to bring color to your home. Tulips are grown from bulbs and may blossom year after year in your flowerbeds, depending upon your climate. Some gardeners opt to re-use their bulbs each year, while others simply discard the old bulbs and start over with new ones each year. If you do want to reuse your tulip bulbs from year to year, cut the flower short approximately three weeks after blooming. Six to eight weeks later, dig the bulbs out of the ground and store. Chill at 40 degrees to 45 degrees Fahrenheit for eight to 10 weeks before re-planting",
        "1 Plant tulip bulbs deep -- about eight inches deep, measuring from the base of the bulb. 2  Note: If you add mulch to the surface after planting, include its depth as a part of your overall planting depth. ( 3 For instance, 5 inches deep in soil plus 3 inches of mulch = 8 inches deep.). 4  Water bulbs after planting. The tulip as duly noted in horticultural texts is a perennial flower. This means that a tulip should be expected to return and bloom year after year. But for all intents and purposes this isn't always the case. Most tulip-lovers content themselves with treating it as an annual, re-planting again each fall.",
        "While you do not need to dig and divide your tulips every year; they should be dug up at least 3-4 years if planted in the ground. If you are not digging them up yearly, make sure they are not in an area of the yard where they will be watered all summer. Too much water over the summer will rot/kill your bulbs. ",
        "Tulips are a different type of bulb and in turn multiply much differently than daffodils-tulip bulbs grow to a top size and then shatter into many smaller bulbs of which probably none will be of even blooming size for several more years. An alternative is to plant these bulbs in a container such as a pot or can, with holes in the bottom for drainage, and this will protect them from those types of pests. Deer are also a problem for tulip flowers once they have sprouted up, they like to eat the flowers right off at the ground. So keep that in mind.",
        "Planting Time. Although tulips can flower within one year of planting, they do not begin to send up foliage and buds immediately. Late fall, about four weeks before the first expected frost, provides the best planting time for tulip bulbs. The bulbs remain semi-dormant through winter as they develop strong root systems. Tulips bloom in several colors. Tulips (Tulipa spp.) grow from bulbs that store all the nutrients and energy the plants require to bloom in spring. Most tulips grow as perennials in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 3 through 8, with a few varieties hardy up to zone 9. Tulip bulbs can bloom within one year of being sown when they are planted and cared for properly",
        "Shop for Tulip Bulbs. As many gardeners know, daffodils are dependable repeaters, perennials that return year after year with more and more blooms. But tulips are somewhat different. The tulip, for all its spectacular beauty, is one of the easiest flowers to grow successfully in the garden. The tulip as duly noted in horticultural texts is a perennial flower. This means that a tulip should be expected to return and bloom year after year. But for all intents and purposes this isn't always the case. Most tulip-lovers content themselves with treating it as an annual, re-planting again each fall."

Best Answer: If you show up for your MRI in sweat clothing (or something similar) with no metal parts, such as buttons, zippers or snaps, you should be able to leave your clothing on during your study. You could even wear regular clothes to your appointment, then change into your sweats just prior to your exam.",
        "Best Answer: You can usually wear your own clothes as long as you're not wearing anything metal (including the metal on bra hooks.) You may have to remove any body jewelry, or they may let you wear it.",
        "Here are some examples: If you are going to have a scan of the lower spine (lumbar spine) or the abdomen area, don't wear clothing or under-clothing that has metal on it in that area. For example, a body suit that has snaps in the crotch, or pants with fasteners or a zipper will cause a problem.",
        "We will ask you to change into a gown if you are wearing clothes that contain metal. You may prefer to arrive for your scan in clothes which do not contain metal, for example you could wear a zipless tracksuit or an elasticated skirt. If you do this you will not have to change for your scan.",
        "Please wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing without zippers, snaps or anything else metallic, as metal interferes with the imaging. If your clothing contains metal, we will provide scrubs for you to wear during the exam. You cannot wear watches, jewelry, or anything else containing metal into the scanner room.",
        "A Brigham and Women's Hospital answered. We encourage our patients to wear loose, comfortable clothing that does not have any metal buttons, snaps, or zippers for a computerized tomography (CT) scan. Otherwise you may be asked to change your clothes and wear a hospital gown. It is best to leave all valuables at home. You may be asked to remove any jewelry, dentures, glasses, or any metal objects that may interfere with the CT scan."

Eye pressure can vary hourly, daily and weekly. Many factors can affect the up and down changes in a person's intraocular pressure. Some optic nerves develop glaucoma even at low pressures (this is called normal-tension glaucoma) so it is important to have the optic nerve examined no matter what the pressure may be.",
        "A Dr. Louis Cantor, MD, Ophthalmology, answered on behalf of American Academy of Ophthalmology's EyeSmart. Normal-pressure glaucoma is diagnosed when the eye pressure is within the normal range of approximately 10 to 21 mm Hg but there is still evidence of the typical optic-nerve damage and vision loss seen in glaucoma. ",
        "Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss. A major risk factor is increased pressure in the eye. The disorders can be roughly divided into two main categories:  open-angle  and  closed-angle  (or  angle closure ) glaucoma. ",
        "Glaucoma is often associated with having increased pressure inside the eye. However, in low tension glaucoma, also called normal-tension glaucoma, optic nerve damage happens even though the pressure is within normal ranges. Although its cause is not completely understood, normal-tension glaucoma is generally believed to occur either because of an unusually fragile optic nerve that can be damaged despite a normal pressure inside the eye, or because of reduced blood flow to the optic nerve. 1  Unusually fragile optic nerves may be inherited.",

        "Most people with glaucoma have high pressure inside the eye that damages the optic nerve. Normal-tension glaucoma (also called low-tension glaucoma) is a unique condition in which optic nerve damage and vision loss have occurred despite a normal pressure inside the eye. Eye pressure, called intraocular pressure (IOP), is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal eye pressure ranges from 10-21 mm Hg. Most people with glaucoma have IOP of greater than 21 mm Hg; however, in normal-tension glaucoma, people have IOP within the normal range.

        "Glaucoma is a multi-factorial, complex eye disease with specific characteristics such as optic nerve damage and visual field loss. While increased pressure inside the eye (called intraocular pressure or IOP) is usually present, even patients with normal range IOP can develop glaucoma. Normal eye pressure ranges from 12-22 mm Hg, and eye pressure of greater than 22 mm Hg is considered higher than normal. When the IOP is higher than normal but the person does not show signs of glaucoma, this is referred to as ocular hypertension.",

        "A byte is abbreviated with a B. (A bit is abbreviated with a small b.) Computer storage is usually measured in byte multiples. For example, an 820 MB hard drive holds a nominal 820 million bytes-or megabytes-of data. Byte multiples are based on powers of 2 and commonly expressed as a rounded off decimal number. For example, one megabyte (one million bytes) is actually 1,048,576 (decimal) bytes.",
        "The terms bit and byte are common in computer networking. Both terms refer to digital data transmitted over a network connection. For example, bits and bytes both may represent network addresses or port numbers. ",
        "A byte usually consists of eight bits. Amounts of computer memory are often expressed in terms of megabytes (1,048,576 bytes) or gigabytes (1,073,741,824 bytes). Usage The word bit is short for bi nary digi t. A bit consists of one of two values, usually 0 or 1. ",
        "A byte is a unit of measurement of the size of information on a computer or other electronic device. A single typed character (for example, 'x' or '8') measures one byte. A single byte generally holds eight bits (bits are, in turn, the smallest unit of storage on a computer, meaning what atoms mean for matter). Bytes are often represented by the letter B. Historically, bytes have been used to encode text characters",
        "A byte is a unit of measurement used to measure data. One byte contains eight binary bits, or a series of eight zeros and ones. Therefore, each byte can be used to represent 2^8 or 256 different values",
        "The byte (/\u02c8ba\u026at/) is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures. The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. ",
        "Bits are usually assembled into a group of eight to form a byte. A byte contains enough information to store a single ASCII character, like h. A kilobyte (KB) is 1,024 bytes, not one thousand bytes as might be expected, because computers use binary (base two) math, instead of a decimal (base ten) system. Similarly, one 1 GB is 1,024 MB, or 1,073,741,824 (1024x1024x1024) bytes. A terabyte (TB) is 1,024 GB; 1 TB is about the same amount of information as all of the books in a large library, or roughly 1,610 CDs worth of data.",
        "Abbreviation for binary term, a unit of storage capable of holding a single character. On almost all modern computers, a byte is equal to 8 bits. Large amounts of memory are indicated in terms of kilobytes (1,024 bytes), megabytes (1,048,576 bytes), and gigabytes (1,073,741,824 bytes). ",
        "The kilobyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The International System of Units (SI) defines the prefix kilo as 1000 (10 3); therefore one kilobyte is 1000 bytes. The unit symbol for the kilobyte is kB. ",
        "A bit is a binary digit, the smallest increment of data on a computer. A bit can hold only one of two values: 0 or 1, corresponding to the electrical values of off or on, respectively. Because bits are so small, you rarely work with information one bit at a time. Similarly, one 1 GB is 1,024 MB, or 1,073,741,824 (1024x1024x1024) bytes. A terabyte (TB) is 1,024 GB; 1 TB is about the same amount of information as all of the books in a large library, or roughly 1,610 CDs worth of data."

        "Q: How long does it usually take a robin to build a nest? Are robins sometimes inept at nestbuilding? I have a robin who started a nest in my front porch light. It appears there is some dirt or mud in the shade and the raffia-type grasses hanging loose and stingy, with no structure, all around the outside of the shade. If you move a robin's nest the parents will most likely abandon the nest, eggs and/or young. Here's why: Nest-site fidelity grows during the nesting season. The more time and energy the birds invest in the nest, the less likely they are to abandon it when disturbed.",
        "Nesting: It takes from two to six days to make the nest, with an average of 180 trips per day to find materials. Males sometimes help gather nesting materials but the female chooses the site and builds the nest. Brooding: The female robin incubates her eggs for about 12 to 16 days. May 16, 2005. Day four since I discovered the robin's nest under my bedroom window. The nest is about 6 1/2 feet above ground, on top of a rose trellis, and about 4 feet below one of my bedroom windows. The mama bird is usually in the nest and I'd like to take a picture of her sitting in her home, but she flies away when she hears me cranking the window open. Yesterday, there were two egg",
        "Nest location and size. The bowl-shaped nests are built in a bush, tree or under the eaves of buildings - 5 to 25 feet off the ground. The nest is 6 inches across and 4 to 6 inches high. The rounded inside area of the nest is about 3.5 to 4 inches in diameter, which is large enough to hold a baseball (see photo below). ",
        "A. It takes two to six days for robins to build their nest. This robin sounds inexperienced. If this is not an appropriate place for her to nest, the quicker she figures it out the better. Sometimes tenacity if important, but this bird is wasting time and energy. If you move a robin's nest the parents will most likely abandon the nest, eggs and/or young. Here's why: Nest-site fidelity grows during the nesting season. The more time and energy the birds invest in the nest, the less likely they are to abandon it when disturbed.",
        "It takes about 3 days for a robin to build its nest!! It was amazing! I \u2026 think it took them as long to build the nest as it did for the eggs to hatch and the babies fly away. Once the eggs hatched within three days we started seeing there heads poke from the nest. In two weeks actually from the day they were born the nest was empty.",
        "An average robin weighs less than three ounces. Let's say an average person weighs 170 pounds, or 1,000 times as much as a robin. A robin's nest, made of grass and mud, weighs about seven ounces, so yours will weigh 450 pounds. You'll need to collect about 350 strands of grass, each about four feet long. And don't forget the mud: 150 pounds of it. ",
        "From that point on, about half of the birds alive in any year will make it to the next. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the whole population turns over on average every six years. The female lays 3-7 light blue eggs that are incubated for 12-14 days and the young leave the nest in about 14-16 days. These birds will return to the same territories from season to season. Sometimes they build a new nest on top of their old one. I've seen as many as three on top of one another. ",
        "Quality Check. The perfect robin nest must serve as a snug baby cradle to keep the eggs and babies warm, dry, and safe with room for you (the mother robin) to hunker down to incubate your young. You weigh about 77 grams. Each of your eggs weighs about 6.3 grams when newly laid. Each baby weighs 5.5 grams when it first hatches. "

        "According to the IUCN, the Gorilla gorilla species (Western lowland gorillas and Cross River gorillas) is critically endangered, with a population reduction of more than 80 percent over three generations (a generation is about 22 years). It is unknown exactly how many of these gorillas are left. Gorillas are generally herbivores. They usually eat vegetation such as wild celery, shoots, roots, fruit, tree bark and tree pulp, but they have been known to eat small animals and insects. A male can eat up to 40 lbs. (18 kg) of vegetation each day. Gorillas' exact diet depends on where they live.",

Mountain gorillas, another endangered subspecies, number at around 700. Gorillas are shy animals that are most active during the day.

        "Gorillas' appearances can vary based on sub-species, but for the most part, the western subspecies tend to be brownish gray in color, while the eastern and mountain gorillas tend to have a more blackish coat. Mountain gorillas also have longer and thicker fur which is adapted to their colder mountainous habitat. Gorillas are shy animals that are most active during the day.

Someone who has had one of these types of polyps has an increased risk of later developing cancer of the colon. Most patients with these polyps, however, never develop cancer.",

Very rarely, polyps are found that have already developed into small cancers; these are called polyp cancers. These are given the name dysplastic polyps or \u201ccarcinoma in situ\u201d.

        "The first games of Australian football were played with a round ball, because balls of that shape were more readily available. In 1860, Australian football pioneer Tom Wills argued that the oval rugby ball travelled further in the air and made for a more exciting game. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are manufactured in a variety of colors and patterns. A regulation football is 28\u201330 cm (11\u201312 in) long and 58\u201362 cm (23\u201324 in) in circumference at its widest point. It weighs 410\u2013460 g (14\u201316 oz) and is inflated to 65.7\u201368.8 kPa (9.5\u201310.0 psi).",
        "Since 1955, the official NFL footballs have been made at the Wilson factory in Ada, Ohio. Each football is handmade from cowhide sourced from Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa. Football fans often perpetuate the idea that footballs used to be made of pigskin, which is how they got their nickname, but it turns out this isn't the case. In fact, pigskins were originally made out of animal bladders\u2014sometimes the bladder of a pig, which is thought to be how the moniker pigskin came about.",

The manufacturing process for the official NFL football made by Wilson: It's fascinating that every football used in the NFL for the past 20-30 years has been made by Deb, Loretta, Peg, Glen, Emmitt, Tina, Etta Mae, Pam, and Michelle. Also, they call the pre-laced, pre-inflated ball a carcass! (thx, peter).",
        "But nope! The NFL\u2019s official footballs are made of premium cowhide leather. According to the NCAA, college teams also use leather footballs, but they\u2019re a little bit smaller than NFL balls. Younger kids (six to eight years old) use smaller footballs made of rubber. That makes it easier for little hands to grip the ball. ",
        "Many companies throughout the world produce footballs. The earliest balls were made by local suppliers where the game was played. It is estimated that 40% of all footballs are made in Sialkot, Pakistan, with other major producers being China and India. In 1863, the first specifications for footballs were laid down by the Football Association. Previous to this, footballs were made out of inflated leather, with later leather coverings to help footballs maintain their shapes.",

        "Photo Credit Thinkstock/Stockbyte/Getty Images. Footballs have been made out of a variety of materials over the years, including bladders, hides, rubber, paint, leather and string. According to Timothy Gay in Football Physics: The Science of the Game, the shape of the ball is a prolate spheroid. The first footballs to be thrown in the 1860s were not thrown in a tight spiral. They were tossed with two hands because they were round. In the days before vulcanized rubber became a commonly produced and purchased material, footballs were made out of pig's bladders.",
        "The oldest football still in existence, which is thought to have been made circa 1550, was discovered in the roof of Stirling Castle, Scotland, in 1981.

        "Step 3. Divide the distance from the pitching rubber to home plate by the speed of the fastball in feet per second. On a major league ball field this distance is 60 feet 6 inches, or 60.5 feet. For a pitch traveling 139.33 feet per second, you have 60.5/139.33 = 0.434 seconds. Your fastball reaction time is therefore equal to 0.434 seconds.",
        "Report Abuse. To react really you have about .24 of a second the rest of the time is how long it takes for you to start your swing. Any longer and you will definitely be late on it. The good hitters can read it and react in less than 2 tenths of a second. Best Answer: At 95 mph, the ball will travel 60'-6, the distance from the pitcher's plate to home plate, in .43 seconds. Of course, you have to start your swing before that to actually make contact with the ball, so the actual reaction time will depend upon your bat speed. Source(s): PEdad \u00b7 7 years ago.",
        "At this speed it takes about four-tenths of a second for the ball to travel the 60 feet, 6 inches from the pitcher's mound to home plate, where the batter, with muscles as tense as coiled springs, like a predatory animal about to pounce, waits for the precise moment to swing at the ball. Baseball is a game played at the edge of biological time, just within the limits of a human's ability to react. Charley Metro: It's a very difficult thing to do, to hit a moving ball at 95 miles an hour in one-tenth of a second!.",
        "It takes less than a half second for a fastball to travel from the pitcher\u2019s hand to home plate. That is all the time you have to react to the pitch. The average person\u2019s reaction time is around 0.75 seconds. This means you must start your swing before the pitcher releases the ball and adjust once the ball has actually been thrown. On a major league ball field this distance is 60 feet 6 inches, or 60.5 feet. For a pitch traveling 139.33 feet per second, you have 60.5/139.33 = 0.434 seconds.

If the horizontal distance from Bruce\u2019s hand to home plate is 17.5 m at the instant of release, how much time does the batter have to react to the pitch and swing the bat? ",
        "In comparing Softball pitching to Baseball pitching, it is the batter s reaction time that has to be determined. For example, at the International and College (and soon to be High School) pitching distance of 43, a batter facing a 60 mph fastball has about 0.42 seconds to react to the pitch. This reaction time is derived from the fact that Distance = Rate times Time. If we assume that the average Softball pitcher releases the ball about 6 feet (yes, superstars like Jenny Finch have a leg stride closer to 7+ feet, but most pitchers do not) from the rubber, the pitching distance equals 37 feet. It takes a 60 mph fastball 0.42 seconds to travel 37 feet.",

As soon as you see swing batter, click on your screen as fast as you can. Fastball Reaction Time imitates a 90-mph fastball thrown by a major league pitcher. While this exhibit doesn't test if you could actually hit a fastball, it does test whether you could react in time to hit one. When you see the swing batter screen, a signal in your eye sends a message to a part of your brain that controls your muscles.",
        "If the batter decides to swing, he must start when the ball is approximately 25 to 30 feet in front of the plate. The ball will arrive at the plate about 250 thousandths of a second later -- about the limit of human reaction time.

A simplistic drawing of those can be seen on this page. Many other smaller gyres exist in the ocean too. One such smaller gyre is the Beaufort gyre found in the Arctic Ocean. The Beaufort gyre is a huge vortex of water being driven by strong winds that force currents in a clockwise direction. This gyre is full of relatively fresh water as Siberian and Canadian rivers drain into the Beaufort gyre.",
        "A gyre in oceanography is any large system of rotating ocean currents, particularly those involved with large wind movements. Gyres are caused by the Coriolis effect; planetary vorticity along with horizontal and vertical friction, which determine the circulation patterns from the wind curl (torque).",
        "What is the Gyre. Gyre Facts. \u2022 A Gyre is a naturally occurring vortex of wind and currents that rotate in a clockwise direction in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere. These create a whirlpool effect, whose vortex moves more slowly at the center and that is where marine plastic debris collects.",
        "Gyres are caused by the Coriolis effect: because the Earth is constantly rotating, ocean currents in the northern hemisphere tend to move in a clockwise direction and currents in the southern hemisphere in an anti-clockwise direction."

He received his patent for the slice toaster in 1921 and formed the Waters-Genter Company to manufacture his product. During the 1930s, toasters were luxuries; some cost up to $25 (the equivalent of $393 in 2010). Thirty years later, however, the toaster price had dropped, and most families were able to afford one. Toasters were also designed to be more compact during this time period to free up counter space.",
        "Toasting bread began as a method of prolonging the life of bread. It was very common activity in Roman times, 'tostum' is the latin word for scorching or burning. The first electric toaster was invented in 1893 in Great Britain by Crompton and Co (UK) and re-invented in 1909 in the United States. It only toasted one side of the bread at a time and it required a person to stand by and turn it off manually when the toast looked done",
        "As a by product of the electric stove the first electric toaster  oven was invented in 1910. A gentleman named William Hadawy who  designed the first electric stove also inv \u2026 ented the toaster.  William developed the idea for the Westinghouse Corporation who is  still a leading producer of toaster ovens today. It's said that  Strite had grown tired of the smell (an \u2026 d most certainly the taste!)  of burnt toast in the company cafeteria, so he set out to fix the  problem.    Strite was granted US Patent 1394450 on October 18, 1921 for his  invention.",

        "Others are formed when the summit of a volcano collapses into an empty magma cavern that had stored the magma prior to eruption. Shield Volcanoes. Shield volcanoes, formed when large flows of lava spread rapidly from central vents or rows of vents, are the largest volcanoes. Because the lava moves rapidly and spreads out in a broad area, it does not form a tall, steep cone. Instead, shield volcanoes are dome-shaped mountains with broad bases and gentle slopes. Stratovolcanoes, or composite volcanoes, get their name from the different layers, or strata, of ash and lava that form them. Most stratovolcanoes are irregularly shaped mountains formed by material ejected from both a central vent and other vents on the sides of the mountain.",
        "A volcano is a vent or fissure in Earth's crust through which lava, ash, rock and gases erupt. A volcano is also a mountain formed by the accumulation of these eruptive products. Let's take a look at how volcanoes form: Earth's crust is 40 to 250 miles (64 to 402 kilometers) thick. Lava Plateaus: Shield volcanoes may erupt along lines of fissures rather than a central vent spilling liquid lava in successive layers. Over time as these layers form broad plateaus such as the Columbia Plateau. These plateaus are often cut by deep canyons that expose the layers of rock.",
        "These volcanoes are formed by low-silica (i.e. basic) lava. Shield volcanoes are built out of layers of lava from continual eruptions (without explosions). Because the lava is so fluid, it spreads out, often over a wide area. A volcano is a mountain where lava (hot, liquid rock) comes from a magma chamber under the ground. Most volcanoes have a volcanic crater at the top. When a volcano is active, materials come out of it.",
        "Lava flow during a rift eruption at Krafla, Iceland in 1984. Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption and the resulting rock after solidification and cooling. This molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. Pillow lava is the lava structure typically formed when lava emerges from an underwater volcanic vent or subglacial volcano or a lava flow enters the ocean. However, pillow lava can also form when lava is erupted beneath thick glacial ice.",
        "Volcanoes are formed when magma from within the Earth's upper mantle works its way to the surface. At the surface, it erupts to form lava flows and ash deposits. Over time as the volcano continues to erupt, it will get bigger and bigger. LAVA-Lava is the liquid rock (magma) that flows out of a volcano. Lava glows red hot to white hot as it flows. ACTIVE VOLCANO-An active volcano is one that erupts regularly. DORMANT VOLCANO-A dormant volcano is one that has not erupted for many years, although there is still some activity deep inside.",
        "Scientists recognize four main types of volcanoes: stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, cinder cones, and ashflow calderas. Stratovolcanoes. Stratovolcanoes, or composite volcanoes, get their name from the different layers, or strata, of ash and lava that form them. Most stratovolcanoes are irregularly shaped mountains formed by material ejected from both a central vent and other vents on the sides of the mountain.",
        "1 Felsic lavas (dacites or rhyolites) tend to be highly viscous (not very fluid) and are erupted as domes or short, stubby flows. 2  Viscous lavas tend to form stratovolcanoes or lava domes. 3  Lassen Peak in California is an example of a volcano formed from felsic lava and is actually a large lava dome. ",
        "Composite volcanoes are formed when both lava and tephra erupt from a central vent. The materials pile up in alternate layers around the vent and form a towering, cone-shaped mountain. Composite volcanoes include Japan's Mount Fuji; Mayon Volcano in the Philippines; and Italy's Vesuvius. Lava is the name for magma that has reached the earth's surface. When lava comes to the surface, it is red hot and may have a temperature of more than 2012 F. (1100 C). Highly fluid lava flows rapidly down a volcano's slopes. Sticky lava flows more slowly.",
        "Shield volcanoes are formed when a large amount of free-flowing lava spills from a vent and spreads widely. The lava gradually builds up a low, broad, dome-shaped mountain. The famous Mauna Loa in Hawaii is a shield volcano. Lava is the name for magma that has reached the earth's surface. When lava comes to the surface, it is red hot and may have a temperature of more than 2012 F. (1100 C). Highly fluid lava flows rapidly down a volcano's slopes. Sticky lava flows more slowly."

Polar bears are found throughout the circumpolar Arctic. They're frequently seen along or near coasts and on islands, but they spend the majority of their lives on the sea ice. Sea ice is vital to polar bears. It provides a platform for them to hunt, live, breed, and in some cases, create maternal dens",

It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi).

They can be found the cold and at times unforgiving land. Polar bears can be found swimming in the frigid oceans waters, or adrift on ice.

        "The matrix is important in the production of ATP with the aid of the ATP synthase contained in the inner membrane. The matrix contains a highly concentrated mixture of hundreds of enzymes, special mitochondrial ribosomes, tRNA, and several copies of the mitochondrial DNA genome. The mitochondrion (plural mitochondria) is a double membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic cells. The word mitochondrion comes from the Greek \u03bc\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, mitos, i.e. thread, and \u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03bd, chondrion, i.e. granule or grain-like.",
        "In the mitochondrion, the matrix contains soluble enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of pyruvate and other small organic molecules. The mitochondrial matrix also contains the mitochondria's DNA and ribosomes. The word matrix stems from the fact that this space is viscous, compared to the relatively aqueous cytoplasm. The cytosolic compartment has a water content of 3.8 \u03bcl/mg protein, while the mitochondrial matrix 0.8 \u03bcl/mg protein",
        "Mitochondria are unusual organelles. They act as the power plants of the cell, are surrounded by two membranes, and have their own genome. They also divide independently of the cell in which they reside, meaning mitochondrial replication is not coupled to cell division. Therefore, power-hungry cells have more mitochondria than cells with lower energy needs. For example, repeatedly stimulating a muscle cell will spur the production of more mitochondria in that cell, to keep up with energy demand.",
        "Mitochondria are enclosed by a double-membrane system made up of an inner and an outer membrane. The space between these two membranes is called (surprise!) the intermembrane space. The inner membrane encloses the interior of the mitochondrion, which is known as the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane contains proteins that comprise the electron transport chain, the ATP synthase enzyme that makes ATP and transport proteins that are needed for allowing the passage of metabolites into and out of the matrix.",
        "The inner membrane is also loaded with proteins involved in electron transport and ATP synthesis. This membrane surrounds the mitochondrial matrix, where the citric acid cycle produces the electrons that travel from one protein complex to the next in the inner membrane. At the end of this electron transport chain, the final electron acceptor is oxygen, and this ultimately forms water (H20). Therefore, power-hungry cells have more mitochondria than cells with lower energy needs. For example, repeatedly stimulating a muscle cell will spur the production of more mitochondria in that cell, to keep up with energy demand.",
        "A dominant role for the mitochondria is the production of ATP, as reflected by the large number of proteins in the inner membrane for this task. This is done by oxidizing the major products of glucose, pyruvate, and NADH, which are produced in the cytosol. The matrix is the space enclosed by the inner membrane. It contains about 2/3 of the total protein in a mitochondrion. The matrix is important in the production of ATP with the aid of the ATP synthase contained in",
        "The electron transport chain is located in the cristae of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The NADH and FADH 2 produced by the citric acid cycle in the matrix release a proton and electron to regenerate NAD + and FAD. The mitochondrial matrix also contains the mitochondria's DNA and ribosomes. The word matrix stems from the fact that this space is viscous, compared to the relatively aqueous cytoplasm.",
        "The short answer: No. Mitochondria are the power-house of the cell. It is where the Electron Transport Chain takes place as well as the production site almost all of the ATP a cell produces.
